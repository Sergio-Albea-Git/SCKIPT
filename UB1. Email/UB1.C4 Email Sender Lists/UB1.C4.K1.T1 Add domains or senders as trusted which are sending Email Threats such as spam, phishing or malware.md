**SCKIPT - Add domains or senders as trusted which are sending Email Threats such as spam, phishing or malware**

Detect senders or domains added in the mailbox Sender List by a User which are delivering Threats

```
//SCKIPT - UB1.C4.K1.T1 Add domains or senders as trusted which are sending Email Threats such as spam, phishing or malware
EmailEvents
| where isnotempty(UserLevelPolicy) and UserLevelAction has "Allow" and isnotempty(ThreatTypes)
| where EmailAction !in ("Send to quarantine", "Move to junk mail folder")
```

On the other hand, I would recommend to configure a Detection Rule, at least, to remove or quarantine emails when they are containing a malware, even if are in user sender list as allowed.

```
EmailEvents
| where ThreatTypes contains "malware" and UserLevelAction contains "Allow"
```
