# SCKIPT
SCKIPT is an initiative created by **Sergio Albea** (sergioalbea.com) focus on detect possible User Behaviours which can put the security of our systems in risk. Nowadays, we have multiple solutions, models and tools that allow us to increase our level of protection against different threats and attacks. However, there are multiple scenarios where the security will rely on how the users interact with their manage systems. SCKIPT can be defined as:

**S** - Source 
**C** - Case scenario
**KI** - Known Interactions with the source
**P** - Possible Protection
**T** - Threat

Every Source is marked as **UB** (Use Behavior) and after it are classified by the different sub-objects.
